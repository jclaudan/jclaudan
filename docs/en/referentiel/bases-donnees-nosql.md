## 1️⃣ Domain Understanding and Technology Choice

### 🎯 Objective
Identify the functional context and choose the appropriate NoSQL database type.

### 💬 Questions to Ask
- What is the purpose of the system?  
- What are the data access patterns (read/write)?  
- What is the data structure (hierarchical, relational, graph)?  
- What are the scalability needs (horizontal/vertical)?  
- What are the consistency constraints (strong/eventual)?  

### 📝 Needs Analysis
| Criterion | Description | Impact on Choice |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Data Volume |  |  |
| Access Speed |  |  |
| Data Structure |  |  |
| Required Consistency |  |  |
| Scalability |  |  |

### 🎯 NoSQL Database Types
| Type | Use Cases | Examples | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Document** | Content, catalogs, profiles | MongoDB, CouchDB | Flexible, native JSON | No complex joins |
| **Key-Value** | Cache, sessions, counters | Redis, DynamoDB | Very fast, simple | Limited to key queries |
| **Column** | Analytics, IoT, logs | Cassandra, HBase | Horizontal scalability | Query complexity |
| **Graph** | Social networks, recommendations | Neo4j, ArangoDB | Complex relationships | No horizontal scalability |

## 2️⃣ Data Modeling

### 🎯 Objective
Define the data structure according to the chosen NoSQL database type.

### 💬 Questions to Ask
- How to organize data to optimize queries?  
- Which data should be denormalized?  
- How to manage relationships between entities?  
- Which indexes are needed?  
- How to structure documents/collections?  

### 📝 Data Structure
| Collection/Document | Fields | Type | Index | Description |

## 3️⃣ NoSQL Design Patterns

### 🎯 Objective
Apply appropriate patterns to optimize performance and maintainability.

### 💬 Common Patterns
- **Embedding vs Referencing**: When to nest vs reference
- **Denormalization**: Duplicate data to optimize reads
- **Aggregation**: Pre-calculate frequently used data
- **Sharding**: Partition data for scalability
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models
